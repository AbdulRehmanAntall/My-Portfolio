                        Hey! I'm Abdul Rehman, a 20-year-old from Lahore, Pakistan. I'm currently in my junior year, studying Computer Science at FAST-NUCES. It’s been a great journey so far, and I’ve enjoyed exploring different areas of tech along the way.

                    <p>

                        I’m someone who loves turning ideas into things people can actually use and remember. Whether it’s coding a fun project, designing something new, or learning a random skill in the middle of the night, I’m always curious and looking for new challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        This portfolio is a collection of my projects, the lessons I’ve picked up, and the version of myself I’m working on. There’s a lot more ahead and I’m just getting started.

                    </p>
